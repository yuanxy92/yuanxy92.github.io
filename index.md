**Short Bio:**
Xiaoyun Yuan is an Associate Professor at the Artificial Intelligence Institute, School of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. He was previously a postdoctoral researcher in the [Sigma lab](https://www.luvision.net/), Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University. He received his B.S. from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2014 and his Ph.D. from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2020. Dr. Yuan has published approximately 20 academic papers in leading journals and conferences, including Nature Biomedical Engineering, Nature Communications, Light: Science & Applications, IEEE TPAMI, and CVPR. His research interests lie in computer vision, computational imaging, photoacoustic tomography, and optical computing. Notably, his work on human brain functional photoacoustic tomography earned the Best Paper Award at SPIE Photonics West 2021.

## Research Interests
My research focuses on computational imaging and visual intelligence, with a strong emphasis on hardware-software co-design and opto-electronic co-optimization. Key areas of my work include <font color="#000099">computational imaging with camera arrays, photoacoustic tomography for brain imaging, and optical computing</font>. Currently, I am exploring the intersection of <font color="#000099">AI + optics, computational imaging + large vision models, and computational imaging + embodied AI</font>. For more details, please visit my [<font color="#990000">Reseach Page</font>](/research/).
We also run an official WeChat public account (OpticAI lab 光影所) where we regularly share updates on our team's work and discuss cutting-edge research ideas. Welcome to follow us!
